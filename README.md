## About Me üë¶

üëã Hi, I'm Wen Jun ‚Äî a dedicated professional with a strong passion for data analytics, machine learning, statistics, and data engineering. My journey in the tech world is driven by a fascination with how data can unlock powerful insights and enable smarter decision-making.

I enjoy building end-to-end solutions ‚Äî from extracting and transforming data to applying machine learning models and visualizing results. My long-term goal is to become a Machine Learning Engineer, combining my skills in analytics, modeling, and engineering to develop intelligent, scalable systems.

## Technical Expertise üë®‚Äçüíª
### Data Analytics & Visualization:
I specialize in SQL, Python, and Tableau/Power BI to clean, model, and visualize large datasets. My projects include SQL-based exploration of public datasets, A/B testing experiments, and dashboard creation for stakeholder reporting.

### Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling:
My machine learning experience spans both supervised and unsupervised learning, including decision trees, Naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors. I‚Äôve worked on scenario-driven applications such as customer segmentation and user journey analysis to uncover behavioral patterns and optimize engagement strategies. In terms of modeling and optimization, I apply techniques like feature selection, regularized regression, forecasting, and function optimization to improve model performance and interpretability. My portfolio also explores advanced topics such as Apriori association rule mining, anomaly detection in time series data, deep learning models, and longitudinal analysis using big data frameworks.

### ETL & Data Engineering:
Experienced with web scraping, working with AWS and StarRocks, and creating pipelines for replicating and syncing data across environments using tools like Pentaho and AWS S3.
<!---**App Development:** I also have experience in developing applications, particularly with R Shiny, enabling me to turn complex analyses into user-friendly web apps.--->

## Goals :dart:
I aim to deepen my expertise in machine learning and cloud-based data engineering. I‚Äôm especially keen on projects involving personalization, automation, and real-time analytics that transform data into competitive advantage.
